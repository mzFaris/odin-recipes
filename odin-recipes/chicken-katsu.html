    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork). </p>

        <li>Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li>Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
